Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Model-to-Predict-the-Placement-Status-of-Student
AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Model to Predict the Placement Status of Student.

Equipments Required:
Hardware – PCs
Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook
Algorithm
1.Data Collection & Preprocessing

2.Select relevant features that impact placement

3.Import the Logistic Regression model from sklearn.

4.Train the model using the training dataset.

5.Use the trained model to predict placement for new student data.
